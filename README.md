# morserino_display

The Morserino-32 is a neat multi-functional Morse device (Keyer, Trainer, Decoder, even Transceiver etc.). It is ideal for learning and practicing Morse code, useful for everybody from beginner to high-speed pro. 

In some cases, it helps to mirror the small built-in screen on a larger PC screen. This is where the `morserino_display` tool can help.
